# portfolio_telebot
this bot is created with aiogram lybrary for taking a receptions, this order is taken from freelance.

There is little categorical-colour-calendar library used here, and it suit perfectly, but unfortunately
there is no full documentation to it. And eventinally after a lot of searching suitable library I edited code of this library.
There is row "plt.savefig('.../telegram-bot/assets/colormap.png')" in the end of definition of draw_colour_calendar function I edited.
This fuction create calendar but don't return something. I know that this is a bad practica but orderer haven't liked other options.
So aside from $pip install -r requirements. txt and creating database you need edit this code to run this bot. Thank godness this project won't be updated.

Also there is database_init.txt file where i have wrote commands of initilization of database. I know that github isn't the place where database must to be and I have created this file instead.
